Question #2: What states are models of high-quality care?

Answer:
State   Score   Num_of_hospitals  Final_Score
-----   -----   ----------------  -------------------
AL      217     91                2.3846153846153846
FL      418     189               2.2116402116402116
OR      126     61                2.0655737704918034
DC      18      9                 2.0
OH      319     170               1.8764705882352941
HI      31      18                1.7222222222222223
TX      571     377               1.5145888594164456
MI      189     137               1.3795620437956204
PA      238     174               1.367816091954023
PR      68      52                1.3076923076923077

Conclusions:

In order to evaluate how one state is performing against another state, you must
look at both how their individual measurements compare to national averages, while
weighting that with the number of hospitals in the state.  Using this approach,
Alabama, Florida, and Oregon were the top three states (with DC, OH, HI, TX, MI,
PA, and PR following).  As an example of how the final score was calculated, when
all of the "Worse than the National Benchmark" results were subtracted from the
number of "Better than the National Benchmark" scores, Alabama ended up with a
total of 217 favorable measurements.  This value was divided by the number of
reporting hospitals to weight the final score appropriately.  While some states
have exceptional hospitals, this approach evaluates the state on a more holistic,
overall vantage point.

Approach:

Each state was awarded one point for a metric that rated "Better than the National
Benchmark" using the complications, infections, and readmissions data from the
Medicare data set for all 4,824 hospitals represented.  Each state lost a point
for any measurements that scored "Worse than the National Benchmark".  These scores
were summed up to generate the "Score" data in the table above.  This score value
was used as the numerator, and the number of hospitals in each state was used as
the denominator to calculate the Final Score.  The weighting by number of hospitals
was important to balance out states with many more hospitals, which resulted in more
opportunities to have "Better than national benchmark" scores.
