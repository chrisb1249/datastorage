Question #1: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals
have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

Answer:

Provid  Hospital Name                           ST      Rank
------  ------------------------------------    --      --
260137  FREEMAN HEALTH SYSTEM - FREEMAN WEST    MO      33
450209  NORTHWEST TEXAS HOSPITAL                TX      32
340091  MOSES H CONE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, THE     NC      29
100018  NAPLES COMMUNITY HOSPITAL               FL      27
450119  SOUTH TEXAS HEALTH SYSTEM               TX      26
110161  NORTHSIDE HOSPITAL                      GA      25
140010  EVANSTON HOSPITAL                       IL      25
100039  BROWARD HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER           FL      24
400109  HIMA SAN PABLO BAYAMON                  PR      24
230070  COVENANT MEDICAL CENTER                 MI      24

Conclusions:

At the heart of any hospital's performance is their ability to cure patients and
to minimize infections, readmissions, and complications.  In order to identify which
hospitals are models of high-quality care, one must identify hospitals that rank
better than the national average on more measurements than their peers.

The above 10 hospitals scored better than the national average on more measurements
in complications, readmissions, and complications than any of the other 4,824 hospitals.
The rank represents a roll-up of the metrics in which they scored well.  The metrics
represented a broad variety of procedures, mortality, and complications/infections
that are critical to providing efficient and effective healthcare.

The Approach:

Upon close inspection of the variety of metrics contained within this data set,
it was apparent that high scores could represent a good result with one metric
and a bad result with another.  I selected off records that included metrics rated as
'better than national average' or 'better than national rate' from the complications,
readmissions, and infections tables and appended them to a table named 'BETTER'.
Once this data was compiled, a roll-up query was run to count the number of
'better than...' measurements at a hospital level.
