Question #3: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

Conclusion:

First and foremost, the data contained within the Timely and Effective Care and
the Readmissions data table are not typically considered 'procedures' in the medical
sense.  However, for the purposes of this exercise, we will treat them as such.

The highest variance seen was with three metrics related to Emergency Department Time
for admitting and releasing patients.  This is as I would have expected due to large
variations in wait times across hospitals.  Interestingly, all 10 of the highest
variance ratings were related to some form of emergency care.  Not seen in this
Top-10 list are the procedures with the lowest degrees of variance, which include:
Death rate for CABG, Heart Failure 30-day Mortality Rate, and several other Death
Rate values.

Approach:

By combining the scores from both the Timely and Effective Care and the Readmissions
tables and converting the scores into an integer, I was able to use the HIVE SQL
Variance operator to calculate variance.  I tested this alongside min, max, avg,
and standard deviation and the results were correct.
